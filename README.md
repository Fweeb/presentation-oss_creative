# Not that Weird: Open Source Tools for Creatives

These are slides to a presentation given in a [lightning talk at Great Wide Open 2016](http://greatwideopen.org/talks/lightning-talks-hosted-by-opensource-com/) in Atlanta, Georgia, US. It was also recorded on video, but that hasn't been publicly posted yet.

To view these specific slides, you'll need to check out this branch (gwo2016-lightningtalk), but a slightly longer version of them can be seen live [here](http://fweeb.github.io/presentation-oss_creative/) (I try to keep them up to date).
